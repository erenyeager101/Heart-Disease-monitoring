# Heart-Disease-Detection

Heart disease detection using hybrid machine learning / ensemble learning involves developing models to predict the presence or risk of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic data. The goal is to improve early diagnosis and facilitate timely treatment, potentially reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on several medical features. We evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the most accurate model.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:

1. `age`: Age of the patient
2. `sex`: 1 = male, 0 = female
3. `cp`: Chest pain type (1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic)
4. `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
5. `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2)
8. `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
9. `exang`: Exercise induced angina
10. `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13. `thal`: 3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect
14. `target`: 1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence of heart disease

## Installation

# Visualization
The project includes a bar plot that compares the accuracy scores of different models.



import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

#Example code to plot the accuracy scores
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))
sns.barplot(x=algorithms, y=scores)
plt.xlabel("Algorithms")
plt.ylabel("Accuracy score")
plt.show()
Saving and Loading Models
The best model (Random Forest in this case, cause the accuracy we fetched using this model was highest in comparison to other algorithms )is saved using pickle for future use.


import pickle

# Save the model
with open('model_randomforestversion2.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(rf, f)

# Load the model
with open('model_randomforestversion2.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(f)
